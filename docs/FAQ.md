# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This document addresses common questions about the NVMe-oF Benchmarking Suite.

## General Questions

### What is NVMe-oF?

NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF) is a technology specification designed to enable NVMe commands to transfer data between a host computer and a target solid-state storage device over a network such as Ethernet, Fibre Channel, or InfiniBand. It extends the high-performance, low-latency benefits of local NVMe storage to network-attached storage systems.

### What does this benchmarking suite do?

The NVMe-oF Benchmarking Suite provides a comprehensive set of tools for evaluating and optimizing the performance of NVMe-oF storage systems. It offers workload generation, performance measurement, bottleneck analysis, and system optimization capabilities.

### Who should use this suite?

This suite is intended for:
- Storage system engineers and architects
- Performance engineers
- Data center administrators
- Storage researchers and enthusiasts
- Anyone looking to optimize their NVMe-oF storage deployment

### What are the system requirements?

At minimum, you need:
- Linux operating system (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or newer recommended)
- C++17 compatible compiler (GCC 9+ or Clang 10+)
- CMake 3.14 or newer
- NVMe-oF target and initiator setup
- SPDK libraries

For development on macOS, we provide a mock implementation for testing and development.

## Technical Questions

### What NVMe-oF transports are supported?

The suite supports the following NVMe-oF transports:
- RDMA (RoCE, InfiniBand)
- TCP
- FC (Fibre Channel)

Support for additional transports is planned for future releases.

### Can I use this with any NVMe device?

Yes, as long as your NVMe device is compatible with the NVMe-oF specification and accessible through the SPDK framework. The benchmarking suite is designed to work with standard NVMe devices.

### How does the bottleneck detection work?

The bottleneck analyzer monitors system resources (CPU, memory, network, storage) during benchmark execution and applies heuristic algorithms to identify components that may be limiting performance. It compares observed metrics against known performance patterns and thresholds to identify potential bottlenecks.

### What metrics are measured?

The suite measures the following metrics:
- Throughput (MB/s)
- IOPS (Operations per second)
- Latency (minimum, maximum, average, percentiles)
- CPU utilization
- Memory usage
- Network throughput
- Queue depths
- Completion times
- Error rates

### Can I create custom workload profiles?

Yes, workload profiles are defined in JSON format and can be customized to match your specific use cases. You can define parameters such as:
- Block sizes
- Read/write ratios
- Random/sequential access patterns
- Queue depths
- Thread counts
- Access patterns

### Is the suite compatible with other benchmarking tools?

Yes, the suite can work alongside other benchmarking tools like FIO and IOzone. In future releases, we plan to add direct integration with these tools to provide a more comprehensive benchmarking environment.

## Practical Questions

### How do I interpret the benchmark results?

The benchmark results provide insights into the performance characteristics of your NVMe-oF setup. The key metrics to focus on are:
- **Throughput**: Measures the data transfer rate in MB/s
- **IOPS**: Measures the number of I/O operations per second
- **Latency**: Measures the time taken to complete I/O operations

The bottleneck analysis will help you identify which component (CPU, memory, network, storage) is limiting performance in your specific configuration.

### What optimization strategies are recommended?

The optimization engine provides tailored recommendations based on detected bottlenecks. Common optimization strategies include:
- Adjusting queue depths
- Modifying block sizes
- Tuning network parameters
- Enabling/disabling features like polling mode
- CPU affinity adjustments
- Memory configuration changes

### How can I compare different NVMe-oF configurations?

The suite provides visualization tools that allow you to compare different benchmark runs. You can:
1. Run benchmarks with different configurations
2. Use the visualization tool to overlay results
3. Analyze performance differences across metrics
4. Identify optimal configurations for your workload

### How accurate are the performance measurements?

The suite is designed to provide high-accuracy measurements with minimal overhead. However, the accuracy may vary depending on:
- System load from other processes
- Operating system scheduling
- Hardware capabilities
- Measurement interval settings

For most accurate results, we recommend running benchmarks on dedicated systems with minimal background activity.

### Can I run the benchmarks in a virtualized environment?

Yes, but with some caveats:
- Performance may be affected by virtualization overhead
- Direct device access (passthrough) is recommended for NVMe devices
- Container-based virtualization (Docker) typically has less overhead than full virtualization

### How do I contribute to the project?

We welcome contributions! Please see our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to contribute code, documentation, or bug reports.

## Troubleshooting

### The benchmark fails to detect my NVMe device

Please check:
- The device is properly installed and recognized by the OS
- You have appropriate permissions to access the device
- The device is not already in use by another application
- SPDK is properly configured to work with your device

### I'm getting compilation errors

Common solutions:
- Ensure you have a C++17 compatible compiler
- Check that all dependencies are installed
- Make sure SPDK is properly installed
- Follow the build instructions carefully
- On macOS, use the mock SPDK implementation
